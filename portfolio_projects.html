            <h3>Sign Language Translator</h3>
            <p>Worked with a team to build a Sign Language Translator that would be able to interpret commands that        can later be used with Amazon Echo. My task was to transform all the gathered data into feature vectors and then feed these features into a Support Vector Machine. I was also in charge of evaluating the accuracy of the model.</p>
            <h3>Lease Renewal Predictor</h3>
            <p>Built a system that would predict if a company would renew their license in Dubai International Finacial Centre. The system proved to be 90% accurate in making predictions. The system was using an algorithm that I built on my own with the help on my mentor.</p>
            <h3>Web Scraping Competitors</h3>
            <p>During my time in DIFC, I was assigned to scrape the firm lists of Multiple Competitors to DIFC. These lists contained more than 5000 entries each. The system was able to scrape them all in a matter of seconds.</p>
